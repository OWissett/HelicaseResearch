# Tasks

1. Load Csv - DONE
2. Normilase data by dividing the min y - DONE

3. Compare normalised data models e.g. statistical 

4. Plot norm graphs - DONE

5. Fit average Graphs if data is good
6. Plot average graphs


>TODO< 
- Create a modle of the dat using function given by remi, start model at Xo (t=5).
  USe the model to compare gradients, use the SMA.
